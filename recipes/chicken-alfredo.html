    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chicken Alfredo is a luscious Italian-American pasta dish featuring tender pieces of chicken served over perfectly cooked pasta, all smothered in a rich and creamy Alfredo sauce.
        <br> 
        This velvety sauce, a blend of butter, cream, and Parmesan cheese, creates a decadent coating that clings to the pasta and chicken, resulting in a sumptuous and deeply satisfying meal.

        Often seasoned with garlic, salt, and pepper, Chicken Alfredo embodies comfort and indulgence, making it a beloved classic that is occasionally personalized with additional ingredients like vegetables or spices for added depth of flavor.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare The Chicken</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Season the chicken with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet, heat some butter over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>
                    Add the chicken and cook until it's no longer pink in the center and has a golden-brown exterior. 
                    <br>
                    This usually takes about 4-6 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the chicken. 
                    <br>
                    Once cooked, remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside.

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cook The Pasta</strong>
            <ul>

            </ul>

        <li>
            <strong>Prepare The Alfredo Sauce</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In the same skillet you used for the chicken, add more butter and minced garlic. 
                    <br>
                    Saut√© the garlic for about a minute until it's fragrant but not browned.

                <li>Pour in the heavy cream and bring it to a simmer, stirring frequently.
                </li>
                <li>Gradually add the grated Parmesan cheese to the cream mixture, stirring constantly until the sauce becomes smooth, 
                    <br>
                    thick, and the cheese is fully melted.
                </li>
                <li>Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste. 
                    <br>
                    You can also add a pinch of nutmeg at this stage if desired for extra flavor.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Combine and Serve</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Slice the cooked chicken into thin strips or bite-sized pieces.</li>
