    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A chicken quesadilla is a savory and satisfying Mexican-inspired dish that consists of tender pieces of chicken and various complementary ingredients folded inside a tortilla. 
        <br>
        The tortilla is typically pan-fried or grilled until it's crispy and golden, encasing the flavorful filling. The chicken is often seasoned and cooked to perfection, and it's combined with ingredients like cheese, onions, bell peppers, and sometimes salsa or other condiments. 
        <br>
        The result is a delicious fusion of flavors and textures, with the tortilla providing a crispy contrast to the gooey, melted cheese and the well-seasoned chicken. 
        <br>
        Chicken quesadillas are often served with sour cream, guacamole, or additional salsa on the side, making them a versatile and customizable dish that can be enjoyed as a snack, appetizer, or main course.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare The Chicken</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Season the chicken with your choice of seasonings, such as cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper.</li>
                <li>
                    Cook the seasoned chicken until it's fully cooked and no longer pink inside. 
                    <br>
                    This can be done by grilling, pan-frying, or baking. Once cooked, slice the chicken into thin strips or small pieces.
